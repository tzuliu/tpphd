Bridging ideal points estimated in two different groups of individuals (e.g., politicians and voters) into a common ideological space is an important, but relatively troubled branch of the ideological scaling literature. The most common procedure is _joint scaling_, which is to merge two groups prior to the joint estimation of ideal points. This procedure has been criticized to ignore the possible differences in structures of ideological space between groups. Alternative approach, _space mapping_, accommodates this issue by estimating a transformation model of two ideological spaces. Existing space mapping techniques, however, are of limited use, since they are not applicable to multi-dimensional and nonparametrically estimated ideal points and require "real" anchors (i.e., individuals who exist in two groups at the same time). Therefore, we propose a more generally applicable technique of space mapping that incorporates ideal points that are multi-dimensional and estimated nonparametrically. Also, our method allows to subsample small numbers of individuals and set them as synthetic anchors: it does not require "real" anchors. We demonstrate the utility of our methodology by comparing its performance with that of joint scaling using two sets of voter-politician data from the United States and Japan. The result suggests that, while it makes less stringent assumptions than joint scaling and is more widely applicable than existing space mapping techniques, our method can generate bridged ideal point estimates comparable to those generated from joint scaling.
