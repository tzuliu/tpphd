Many recent cross-national studies analyse the causes and electoral consequences of partypolicy shifts, using party position measures derived from election manifestos, expert surveys or votersurveys. However few studies validate their findings by analysing multiple measures of party policy shifts. Inthis article, data on European parties’ position shifts on both European integration and left-right ideologyis analysed, showing that this is problematic because, while alternative measures of party policy positionscorrelate strongly in cross-sectional analyses, alternative measures of parties’ policy shifts are essentiallyuncorrelated in longitudinal analyses. Suggestions are offered on how to address this problem.

Keywords: party policy shifts; expert surveys; party manifestos; voters' perceptions of parties' positions
