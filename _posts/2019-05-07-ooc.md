This paper develops an extension of Poole’s (2000) Optimal Classification (OC) scaling procedure
to the analysis of polytomous or ordered choice data. This type of data is regularly encountered
in public opinion and expert surveys, legislative and judicial bodies where abstention is relevant,
and measures of policy that are coded along ordinal scales. OC is nonparametric and requires only
minimal assumptions about voters’ utility functions and the error term. As such, Ordered Optimal
Classification (OOC) provides a flexible modeling strategy to estimate latent ideological spaces from
ordinal choice data. OOC is also easily estimated in multidimensional space without identifying
restrictions. After describing the OOC procedure, we perform a series of Monte Carlo experiments
and apply the method to analyze survey data from the 2015 Cooperative Congressional Election
Study. We then conclude with a discussion of how scholars can utilize OOC in future work involving
multidimensional spatial models of choice.
