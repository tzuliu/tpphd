Numerous studies of comparative political behavior examine how voters perceive parties’ ideological positions on various policy issues, either in a standard uni-dimensional space or on single issues, most notably the European Union. These studies, however, often make a large assumption about these ideological positions: they are assumed to be representative of the entire governing coalition, classifying the government as a single unitary actor rather than a collection of individual parties each with their own positions. While a common assumption when assessing coalition governments' ideological positions, it is unclear whether this logic of shared accountability holds for voters' perceptions of valence. To fill this gap, I use a conjoint experiment to assess the perceptual influence of valence issues on coalitional accountability. I find that when any member of a (coalition) cabinet, including the prime minister, is involved in a political scandal, voters tend to devalue the (coalition) cabinet as a whole, instead of merely blaming that specific member. Overall, my results show that unlike standard left-right ideological positions, voters project the prime minister’s and (junior) cabinet members’ low valence bidirectionally onto each other. This research has implications for the prime minister's selection process for (junior) cabinet members and junior parties’ own calculus of whether to participate in a coalition or not.
