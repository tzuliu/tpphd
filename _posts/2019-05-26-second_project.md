Based on the theory of valence issues, scandals are salient due to they may reveal low-cost information about a politician's honesty, integrity, or competence. However, our understanding regarding how non-corruption scandals affect voters’ evaluation of politicians is still limited due to unrealistic design and narrow focus of corruption-related scandals. To complete the literature, this project adopts a conjoint analysis design to assess the following questions: 1) Do non-corruption political scandals affect how citizens evaluate politics? 2) Is the effect of scandal heterogeneous by certain attributes? 3) Does the effect spill-over within the cabinet? The evidence shows that scandals, particularly sexual harassment, lowers politicians’ evaluations, and this penalty is significantly stronger than and could be mitigated by the partisan and policy preferences. Furthermore, when one of the cabinet members is involved in a scandal, voters tend to blame the whole cabinet, regardless of whether it is a coalition government or not.
