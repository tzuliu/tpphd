Ideal point estimation and dimensionality reduction have long been utilized to simplify and cluster high-dimensional data. However, the derived latent spaces from theses methods are sometimes uninformative in explaining significant differences in the data. To tackle this prevalent issue, we adopt an emerging analysis approach, called contrastive learning. We contribute to the field of contrastive learning by extending it to multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) in order to enable an analysis of data often encountered by social scientists---namely binary, ordinal, and nominal variables. We demonstrate the utility of contrastive MCA (cMCA) by analyzing three different surveys. Our results suggest that, first, for the cases when MCA depicts differences between groups, cMCA can further identify characteristics that divide the target group; second, for the cases when MCA does not show clear differences, cMCA can successfully identify meaningful directions and subgroups, which traditional methods overlook.
