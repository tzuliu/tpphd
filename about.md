I am a Ph.D. candidate from the [Department of Political Science](https://ps.ucdavis.edu/ "UCD PoliSci") at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/ "UC Davis"). My research interests include: `Western European politics`, `causal inference`, `ideal point estimation`, `time-series analysis`, `machine learning`, `text analysis`, `nlp`, and `network analysis`. All the data, paper, and replication codes of finalized projects and ongoing projects could be reached at [my Github page](https://github.com/tzuliu "tpliu github").
