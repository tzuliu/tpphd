This is Tzu-Ping Liu. I am a Ph.D. from the [Department of Political Science](https://ps.ucdavis.edu/ "UCD PoliSci") at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/ "UC Davis") and currently an assistant professor at the [Department of Social and Public Affairs](https://public.utaipei.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=zh-tw) at the [University of Taipei](https://www.utaipei.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=zh-tw). My research focuses on two subfields&mdash;comparative politics and political methodology. In general, my research interests cover Western European politics, Asian politics, causal inference, time-series analysis, survival analysis, machine learning, computational linguistics, and network analysis. My works have been published at ***European Journal of Political Research***, ***Japanese Journal of Political Science***, and ***Public Choice***.
