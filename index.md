This is Tzu-Ping Liu. I am a Ph.D. candidate from the [Department of Political Science](https://ps.ucdavis.edu/ "UCD PoliSci") at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/ "UC Davis"). In general, my research focuses on two subfields&mdash;comparative politics and political methodology. More precisely, my research interests cover Western European politics, Asian politics, causal inference, time-series analysis, survival analysis, machine learning, computational linguistics, and network analysis. My works have been published at ***European Journal of Political Research***, ***Japanese Journal of Political Science***, and ***Public Choice***.
